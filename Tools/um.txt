Command line options

      um.com or um    - start the utility
      um /v           - start in verbose mode
      um /V           - start in verbose mode


Programming of FlashROM
-----------------------

The cartridge v3.5 or the cartridge converted from v3.0 to v3.5 can be programmed from MSX-DOS on a real MSX computer. The utility called UM.COM is
able to write any ROM file into the FlashROM chip when the programming mode is enabled. The procedure is very simple:

 - Set the jumper to enable the "Programming mode"
 - Boot from an MSX-DOS diskette or from a multi-functional cartridge into MSX-DOS2
 - Run the UM.COM utility
 - Select the desired mapper
 - Input the desired ROM file's name without the .ROM extension
 - After flashing is complete, power down a computer and set the jumper to "Normal mode"

If the tool outputs the "Wrong FlashROM ID" message and exits, then either the cartridge is not in the programmable mode or the FlashROM chip is bad
or missing. Please mitigate the problem and try again.

If for some reason the cartridge doesn't allow a computer to boot even when the "Programming mode" is selected, please remove the FlashROM chip from
the cartridge's socket and erase it in the EEPROM programmer.
